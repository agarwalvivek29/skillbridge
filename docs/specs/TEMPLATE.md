## Technical Design

### Architecture Overview
[High-level description of the approach. Include a diagram if helpful (ASCII or Mermaid).]

```
[Optional: ASCII diagram of data flow or component interaction]
```

### API Changes

#### New Endpoints
```
POST /v1/[resource]
Request: { ... }
Response: { ... }
```

#### Modified Endpoints
[List any changes to existing endpoints]

#### Removed Endpoints
[List any endpoints being removed and the migration path]

### Data Model Changes

#### New Tables / Collections
```sql
-- or show JSON schema for MongoDB
CREATE TABLE [name] (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  ...
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

#### Modified Tables
[Show ALTER TABLE statements or schema diff]

### Queue / Event Changes
[New events published or consumed, with payload schema]

### Dependencies
[New packages, services, or infrastructure needed]

---

## Security Considerations

- [Authentication/authorization implications]
- [Data exposure risks]
- [Rate limiting needs]
- [Input validation requirements]

---

## Observability

- **Logs**: What should be logged? At what level?
- **Metrics**: Any new metrics to track? (e.g., queue depth, latency percentile)
- **Alerts**: Should any alert be created for failure conditions?

---

## Testing Plan

### Unit Tests
- [What functions/modules need unit tests]

### Integration Tests
- [What interactions need integration tests]

### Manual Testing Steps
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]

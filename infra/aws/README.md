# AWS Infrastructure

This directory contains AWS infrastructure configuration and guidelines.

---

## Conventions

### Environments

| Environment | Purpose | Branch |
|---|---|---|
| `local` | Local dev via docker-compose | any |
| `dev` | Shared development environment | `main` |
| `staging` | Pre-production validation | `release/*` |
| `prod` | Production | `main` (tagged) |

### Naming Convention

All AWS resources follow: `{project}-{service}-{environment}-{resource-type}`

Examples:
- `myproject-auth-service-prod-rds`
- `myproject-api-gateway-dev-lambda`
- `myproject-events-staging-sqs`

### Tagging

All resources must be tagged:
```
Project:     [project-name]
Service:     [service-name]
Environment: [local|dev|staging|prod]
ManagedBy:   [terraform|cdk|manual]
Owner:       [team-name]
```

## Infrastructure as Code

Prefer IaC over manual console changes:
- **AWS CDK** (TypeScript) — recommended for new projects
- **Terraform** — acceptable for existing projects or multi-cloud

IaC definitions live in `infra/aws/[service-name]/` or `infra/cdk/`.

Any manual console change must be:
1. Documented in an ADR
2. Followed up with an IaC equivalent
3. Applied to all environments

## Secrets Management

- **Local**: `.env` files (gitignored)
- **Dev/Staging/Prod**: AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store
- Never store secrets in environment variables injected via CI plain text
- Rotate secrets on team member offboarding

CI/CD reads secrets via:
```yaml
- uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
  with:
    role-to-assume: ${{ secrets.AWS_ROLE_ARN }}
    aws-region: us-east-1
```

---

## Common Services Used

| AWS Service | Purpose |
|---|---|
| ECS Fargate | Container hosting |
| RDS (Postgres) | Relational database |
| ElastiCache (Redis) | Cache / sessions |
| MSK (Kafka) | Event streaming |
| SQS | Simple queuing |
| S3 | Object storage |
| CloudFront | CDN |
| API Gateway | HTTP API proxy |
| Secrets Manager | Secret storage |
| CloudWatch | Logs and metrics |
| ECR | Container registry |

---

## GitHub Actions AWS Auth

Use OIDC (not long-lived access keys) for CI/CD authentication:

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read

steps:
  - uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
    with:
      role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/github-actions-role
      aws-region: us-east-1
```

Set up the OIDC trust relationship once per AWS account. See AWS docs for the IAM role configuration.
